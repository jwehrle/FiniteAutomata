# FiniteAutomata
This is a simple program that analyzes regular expressions using either
a Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) or a Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA). 

Currently, the testing program has a hard coded regular expression but
I will be updating main with options for setting your own regex. 
Also, I will be adding validation for properly formed Finite State Machines.
